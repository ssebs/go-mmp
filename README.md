# Go-MMP
Macro Pad driver software, written in Golang. 
If you have an arduino powered device, you could use this to run various keyboard shortcuts and other macros.

Here's what the GUI looks like, you can click the buttons to run the macro, or use the arduino to press them.
![screenshot of gui](res/GUIScreenshot.png)

## What kind of macros can you make?
- Shortcuts:
  - CTRL + C, CTRL + V, etc.
- Press whatever key you want, as long as it's [in the list](https://github.com/go-vgo/robotgo/blob/master/docs/keys.md#keys).
  - Skip song, type "enter", etc.
- Repeat keypresses (or mouse button presses)
  - Playing cookie clicker? Press your macro to repeatedly press your mouse button down until you click the macro again
- More? 

### You can add multiple "actions" to a macro
If you want a single button to type "ggez" for you in VALORANT or CS, you can!
- You just need to add 3 actions:
  - Shortcut: shift+enter
  - SendText: ggez
  - PressRelease: enter

## Hardware
You'll need an arduino with some buttons. I'm using a Teensy LC, but you could use an Arduino Micro or ESP32.

## 3D Printed housing
There are many available, but if you like the one I designed, check out my [thangs.com](https://than.gs/m/710028) profile.

<!-- TODO: Add video of it -->

## Usage
- You'll need an arduino/serial based device that sends [0-9] numbers over a serial connection.
  - See [arduino-mmp.ino](./arduino-mmp.ino) source code to see how I did this.
  - Connecting and understanding baudrate, etc. is out of the scope of this guide.
- Download the app
  - [Download go-mmp.exe](https://github.com/ssebs/go-mmp/releases/)
  - [Build from source](#building)
- Double click the **go-mmp.exe** file
- It will generate a config for you at `$HOME/mmp-config.yml`
    - e.g. `C:\Users\ssebs\mmpConfig.yml` or `/home/ssebs/mmpConfig.yml`
  - You can see what will be generated by looking at the [defaulyConfig.yml file](./res//defaultConfig.yml)
    - Take a look here to see what the file format should look like
  - You can edit this config from a text editor like Notepad, VSCode, or vim
    - All config changes must be made in this file, **this is how you create macros**
    - If someone would like to create a GUI based editor, please feel free 😁
- In the config file, this is where you configure:
  - The MacroPad's layout (3x3 buttons)
  - The serial device info (portname, buad, etc)
    - You'll need to find out what the Serial port name is
  - The Macros themselves
    - The digit is used to position the macros, so keep the 1,2,3,4... for each macro you want.
    - Name:
      - This is what shows up on the buttons in the GUI. You can use emojis here.
    - Actions:
      - List of Actions, see [Actions](#actions) section below
- When you press a button on the Arduino based MacroPad, it should run the macro.
- You can also click the button in the UI to run the macro.

### Don't have an arduino but still want to run macros?
You can still run this in GUI only mode, but you'll need to open up a terminal

Open a terminal to where the go-mmp.exe file is
- Run `PS> go-mmp.exe --gui-only` and hit enter.

CLI Usage:
> Not sure why, but the print statements stop working after I export to exe, so no help message.
```
Usage of go-mmp.exe:
  -gui-only
        Open Go-MMP in GUI Only Mode. Useful if you don't have a working arduino.
  -reset-config
        If you want to reset your mmpConfig.yml file.
```

## Actions:
All the available actions are listed below, the format is:
  ```yaml
  Actions:
    # FuncName: parameter
  ```

Example Actions:
  ```yaml
  Actions:
    - Shortcut: SHIFT+ENTER
    - SendText: ggez
    - PressRelease: enter
  ```

### The following Actions are available:
> The keyname must be found in https://github.com/go-vgo/robotgo/blob/master/docs/keys.md#keys, or if it's a mouse button then it should be "LMB", "RMB", "MMB"

#### PressRelease
- e.g. `enter`, `a`, `alt`, `LMB`
- Press and release a key or mouse button.

#### Press
- e.g. `enter`, `a`, `alt`, `LMB`
- Press and hold a key, to release a key use "Release".

#### Release
- e.g. `enter`, `a`, `alt`, `LMB`
- Release a key from being held.

#### SendText
- e.g. `ggez`, `Thanks, ssebs`, `git-gud`
- Type out text from the keyboard.

#### Shortcut
- e.g. `CTRL+SHIFT+ESC`, `CMD+C`, `CMD+R`
  - Hotkey sequence, split up by "+" chars. All keys between the "+"'s will be pressed at the same time.
  - NOTE: The "Windows" button is "CMD", same for the "Command" button on a Mac.
- Run a shortcut by typing multiple keys at once.

#### Delay
- e.g. `10ms`
- You must enter a duration string. A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
  - This will add a delay of the time you select.
  - This is useful if your set of actions are too fast and you need to slow them down.
- 
#### Repeat
- e.g. `LMB+50ms`, `z+500ms`
  - KeyName + delay sequence, split up by "+" chars. Only 1 "+" is allowed, so you MUST only put 1 key/mouse button on the left, and a duration string on the right.
- Press and repeat a key or mouse button over and over with the delay between each press.
  - The delay must be formatted as a duration string like above.

## Building
#### Get the code
- git clone https://github.com/ssebs/go-mmp
  - You'll need to install a C compiler. See https://developer.fyne.io/started/
  - If you want to use the Makefile on Windows, [install make from choco](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57042516)
- `go get github.com/ssebs/go-mmp`

#### Build the code
- `make build` to build the go-mmp.exe file
- `make run` to run the go-mmp.exe file
- `make test` to run unit tests
- `make pkg` to package for Windows
  - For other platforms:
    - Make sure `fyne` CLI is installed
      - `go install fyne.io/fyne/v2/cmd/fyne@latest`
    - Windows:
      - `PS go-mmp> fyne package -os windows`
    - Mac:
      - `$ fyne package -os darwin`
    - Linux:
      - `$ fyne package -os linux`
